# WildfirePy's Vision Statement

## About WildfirePy

WildfirePy is a community-developed and community-driven, free and open-source Python package for wildfire data analysis, tracking and simulation.

## Motivation

A wildfire is an unplanned fire that burns in a natural area such as a forest, grassland, or prairie. Wildfires are often caused by human activity or a natural phenomenon such as dry climate, lightning and volcanic eruptions, and they can happen at any time or anywhere. In 50% of wildfires recorded, it is not known how they started.

Wildfires are devasting phenomena which cause loss of humongous volumes and variety of flora and fauna owing to their uncontrolled nature. They also pose a threat to the quality of life for humans, constituting the hazards of suffocation, burns, injuries and air pollution leading to a range of health issues. Wildfires have a significant and detrimental impact on the weather and climate by releasing large quantities of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter into the atmosphere.

Scientific organizations worldwide have been working towards forecasting and preventing this calamity. They have collected colossal databases recording wildfires, their triggers and repercussions -- most of which are publicly available. However, this information is often localized and stored in inconsistent formats. This is where WildfirePy comes in.

WildfirePy can be used to collect data from these sources for analysis. This package can be used to visualize this data as well as track and simulate wildfires. WildfirePy seeks to play its part in the prevention, detection, control and suppression of wildfires.
